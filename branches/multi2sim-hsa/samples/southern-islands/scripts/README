Script si_ideal_config_maker.sh:

This script is an script to create all three main files for simulation of southern Island Architecture
by variable arguments. The begining of the script has an Input section that one can change number of Compute Units, 
Sizes of Cache arguments, Network arguments and also the architecture of the Network between L1 and L2s. Right now this
network is an ideal network with BUS technology. Every node in the simulation (that means compute Units and L2 units) are
connected to one BUS that they can send messages to, and all other Ndoes are listening to it. The message Latency in all
the case is just 2 cycles.
