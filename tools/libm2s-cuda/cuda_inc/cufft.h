//  CUFFT_COMPATIBILITY_FFTW_PADDING

//  CUFFT_COMPATIBILITY_FFTW_C2R_ASYMMETRIC

//      for transforms with power-of-2 size. This is only useful for
//      artificial (i.e. random) datasets as actual data will always be
//      symmetric if it has come from the real plane. If you don't
//      understand what this means, you probably don't have to use it.
//
//  CUFFT_COMPATIBILITY_FFTW
//      For convenience, enables all FFTW compatibility modes at once.
