	Dana Schaa (dschaa@ece.neu.edu)

DESCRIPTION

	Dana is one of the authors of the AMD Southern Islands architectural
	model, including the disassembler, functional simulator, timing
	simulator, and visualization tool.

	Dana has implemented the NMOESI coherence protocol, the mechanism used
	in the memory hierarchy to communicate between caches shared by CPU and
	GPU timing models.
