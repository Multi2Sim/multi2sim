AUTHOR
	Dana Schaa (dschaa@ece.neu.edu)

DESCRIPTION

	Dana is one of the authors of the AMD Southern Islands architectural
	model, including the disassembler, functional simulator, timing
	simulator, and visualization tool.

	Dana has implemented the NMOESI coherence protocol, the mechanism used
	in the memory hierarchy to communicate between caches shared by CPU and
	GPU timing models.

	Rustam Miftakhutdinov (rustam@mail.utexas.edu)

DESCRIPTION

	Rustam has implemented support for application checkpointing in the x86
	emulator, adding options --x86-load-checkpoint, --x86-save-checkpoint,
	and --x86-last-inst to the command-line interface.

AUTHOR
	Sudhanshu Shukla (sudhan@iitk.ac.in)

DESCRIPTION
	
	Sudhanshu has implemented support for a set of SSE instructions in the
	x86 emulator. He has implemented a register renaming mechanism for XMM
	registers in the x86 timing simulator, and improved the algorithm of
	micro-code generation for SSE instructions.
