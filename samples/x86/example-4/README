% Example to test the x86 detailed simulation with one multi-threaded
% application running multiple concurrent threads on a CPU with 2 cores
% each capable of running two threads.
% 
% For this test first we should build the binary from the source code
% and then use this binary for Multi2sim

% Building the binary
gcc test-threads.c -o test-threads -lpthread -m32 || exit

% Using the binary in multi2sim
$M2SROOT/bin/m2s --x86-sim detailed --x86-config x86-config.ini \
		--ctx-config ctx-config.ini
