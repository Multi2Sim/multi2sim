This network has a cycle. It is a 5x2 torus.

--net-sim net0 --net-config net-config.ini --net-injection-rate 32 --net-msg-size 144 --net-max-cycles 120 --net-visual net2.vis --net-debug net.debug

If pointers are not freed, its due to inflight packets. The packet is ditached from message but not re-attached again. A cycle may lead to a dead-line in which
case the packets never arrive at their destination. Since packets are inflight neither them nor their stack will be freed, resulting in unfreed space.

This should be resolved.
