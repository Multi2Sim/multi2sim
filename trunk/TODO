-Non-blocking caches and cache ports:

(2) As for non-blocking caches, I can't find any code on MSHRs(miss
status handling registers, or miss bufferes) for accommodating
concurrent in-flight misses. I cite  the following simple definition
from http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/arch/latency-nb-pre.html
for your quick reference, which is not equivalent to multi-port caches
as you pointed out:

"A non-blocking cache allows execution to proceed concurrently with
cache misses as long as dependency constraints are observed, thus
exploiting post-miss operations."
